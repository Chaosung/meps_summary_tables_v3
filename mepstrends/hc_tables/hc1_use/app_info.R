  description = "The MEPS online summary tables provide an interactive platform allowing users to quickly 
    access statistics on health care utilization and expenditures. Some of the types of data available here include: mean and 
    median expenditures per person, total number of healthcare events and average spending per event type. 
    Data can be grouped by event type (such as prescription medicines or dental services), 
    by source of payment (such as Medicare or Medicaid), or by demographic characteristics (such as age, race or sex).",
  
  instructions = "Use the options below to select a variable of interest, 
    the data view ('Trends over time' or 'Cross-sectional'), data years, and grouping variables.
    If the 'Trends over time' view is selected, a range of years can be chosen.
    The 'Cross-sectional' view displays a single year, which can be stratified by two grouping variables.
    Once a grouping variable is selected, a dropdown will appear, enabling selection of specific levels in
    each group, including population totals.

    After selecting the available options, the data Table will automatically be updated. 
    The data can be viewed as a plot under the 'Plot' tab, with line graphs for Trends over time, 
    and grouped bar graphs for the cross-sectional view. The 'Code' tab displays R and SAS code needed to 
    replicate the data shown in the Table. 
    The generated Table, Plot, and Codes can be downloaded using the download button under each tab.

    To view standard errors in the Table or 95% confidence intervals in the Plot, 
    select the 'Show Standard Errors' checkbox."
