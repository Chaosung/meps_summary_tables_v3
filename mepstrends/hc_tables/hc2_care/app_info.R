  description = "This MEPS online summary table provides statistics on accessibility and quality of care,
  such as the percent of the population with a usual source of care, difficulty accessing needed care,
  persons with diabetes care, and patient-reported quality of doctor's visits. Data can be viewed over 
  time or for a single year by demographic characteristics (such as age, race or sex).",
  
  instructions = "Use the options below to select a variable of interest, 
  the data view ('Trends over time' or 'Cross-sectional'), data years, and grouping variables.
  If the 'Trends over time' view is selected, a range of years can be chosen.
  The 'Cross-sectional' view displays a single year, which can be stratified by two grouping variables.
  Once a grouping variable is selected, a dropdown will appear, enabling selection of specific levels in
  each group, including population totals.
  
  After selecting the available options, the data Table will automatically be updated. 
  The data can be viewed as a plot under the 'Plot' tab, with line graphs for Trends over time, 
  and grouped bar graphs for the cross-sectional view. The 'Code' tab displays R and SAS code needed to 
  replicate the data shown in the Table. 
  The generated Table, Plot, and Codes can be downloaded using the download button under each tab.
  
  To view standard errors in the Table or 95% confidence intervals in the Plot, 
  select the 'Show Standard Errors' checkbox."
